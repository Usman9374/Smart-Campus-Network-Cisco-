# Smart-Campus-Network-Cisco-
For my Computer Networks final project, I designed and simulated a Smart Campus Network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It features VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, wireless connectivity, and network security. The network connects two departments, manages IoT devices, and ensures secure communication, providing a scalable solution for campus infrastructures.
